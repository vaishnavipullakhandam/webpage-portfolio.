    <h3> 1. Comments </h3>
    
    <p>
    Comments are used as notes for the reader or the programmer himself if he's viewing the source code after a long time. the way to write a comment is easy. there are two types of comments. 1. single-line comment , 2. multiple-line comment.</p>
    <h4>  single-line comment </h4>
    <p> single-line comments are used to express thoughts or write notes in a single line, just as the name suggests.<span id="span"> Syntax : #HelloWorld </span> anything written after the ' # ' symbol will not be executed and can only be viewed in the source code </p>
    <h4> multiple-line comment </h4>
    <p> multiple-line comment is used when you need to describe something which would go over more than a single line. <span id="span"> </span></p>
